### Claude Code Setup Process
1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   cd reasoning-ml-pipeline
   claude
   ```

2. **Initial Configuration**
   - Created CLAUDE.md with project context
   - Set up .claude/commands/ directory
   - Configured development environment

3. **Challenges Encountered**
   - Issue with PyTorch installation
   - Problem with MLflow setup
   - Solution: [Describe solution]

### Code Changes
- Created project structure
- Added requirements.txt with dependencies
- Configured FastAPI server
- Set up MLflow tracking

### Learnings
- Claude Code works best with clear, specific instructions
- CLAUDE.md is crucial for maintaining context
- Project structure setup is foundational

### Next Steps
- Implement model architectures
- Set up training pipeline
